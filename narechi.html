        <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/JustACoderWanderingAround/their-last-ride"> Their Last Ride</a> is a 2D Windows game that was created in 2 weeks during my first semester of my diploma in NYP (Nanyang Polytechnic).
        <br><br>
            It was created in collaboration with my groupmates Ray, Tania, Paul and Jude during our Studio Project which we were randomly allocated as groupmates together.
            I was the <strong class="cyan">lead programmer</strong> and <strong class="red">project manager </strong>in the team.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            There is a fine line between <strong>life</strong> and <strong>death</strong>, and in this world, it's a train line. You are the <strong class="cyan">Ticketmaster</strong>, and it is up to you to determine which passengers belong to the world of the living and the world of the dead. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            Impacts
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Programming
        </h3>
        <p>
            I programmed the renderer which utilized the free SDL2 library. I also created
            the asset import pipeline and created an API for my team to use to render 
            sprites on the screen. This API was responsible for majority of the 
            game and enabled my teammates to create some gameplay features. I also worked on gameplay features alongside
            the core of the framework like:
        </p>
        <ul class="purple">
            <li>Gameplay Loop</li> 
            <li>JSON Level Loading</li> 
            <li>Dialogue System</li> 
            <li>UI Buttons/Picking</li> 
            <li>Font Loading</li> 
        </ul>

        <h3>
            Teamwork
        </h3>
        <p>
            I had to work with teammates that were less capable than me at C++, not 
            only that, but they had no knowledge of <span class="blue">GitHub</span>, a VCS (Version Control System) tool
            that is more or less mandatory when working with a team.
            <br><br>
            I learnt to be patient with my teammates and learnt that how to empathize with them
            and be realistic with my expectations from my teammates. This helped us to
            be able to finish our project in time for the deadline.
