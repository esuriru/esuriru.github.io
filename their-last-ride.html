            Their Last Ride
        </h2>
        <p>
        <a href="http://gg.gg/their-last-ride"> Their Last Ride</a> is a game that was created in 2 weeks during my first semester of my diploma in NYP (Nanyang Polytechnic).
        <br><br>
            It was created in collaboration with my groupmates Ray, Tania, Paul and Jude during our Studio Project which we were randomly allocated as groupmates together.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            There is a fine line between <strong>life</strong> and <strong>death</strong>, and in this world, it's a train line. You are the <strong class="cyan">Ticketmaster</strong>, and it is up to you to determine which passengers belong to the world of the living and the world of the dead. 
        </p>

        <h2>
           Takeaways 
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Team
        </h3>
        <p>
            It was my first time working in a team, especially with GitHub, I had never collaborated using it, so it was a huge pain to deal with merge conflicts.
            <br><br>
            My groupmates had also no experience with GitHub so I had to teach them along the way. I thought that the overhead of teaching my groupmates was way easier than not havintg the convenience of GitHub.
            <br><br>
            More/resultant problems on GitHub include:
        </p>

        <ul class="red">
            <li>Doing all our tasks on main branch</li>
            <li>Undescriptive commit messages</li>
            <li>Working with two versions of Visual Studio</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Though, that last one is not really GitHub's fault.
            <br><br>
            A naming convention was also not thoroughly enforced, hence resulting in inconsistent naming of variables, functions and the like.
            <br><br>
