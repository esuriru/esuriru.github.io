        <h2>Equilibria</h2>
        <p>
        <a href="https://kaysensei.itch.io/equilibria">Equilibria</a> is a 2D Windows and Web game that was submitted for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024">2024 GMTK Game Jam</a> which placed 
        <span class="purple">94th</span> out of more than 7500 entries.

        <br><br>
            With a theme of <i>"Built to Scale"</i>, it was created with a team of 12 artists, sound designers and programmers. I was a <span class="red">Gameplay and UI programmer</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>Theme</h2>
        <p>
            Our initial idea was a puzzle game involving scaling the player's size. In the end, we felt this idea might be too generic and decided to go the LITERAL route.
<br><br>
'Scale' becomes a literal SCALE.
'Scale' can also means size, size means WEIGHT.

With this in mind, we came up with a unique tower defence game involving a <strong class="red">LITERAL</strong> scale!
        </p>

        <h2>
            Impacts
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Programming
        </h3>
        <p>

            <br>
            I worked on the core wave spawning of the game, in which the other programmers used
            to create the levels of the game. I also helped to review and debug the other programmers' code.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Design
        </h3>
        <p>
            I designed asset modifications that would make the visuals pop brighter like <span class="purple">glowing text</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Teamwork
        </h3>
        <p>
            As the main programmers were busy with their gameplay tasks and creating the levels, I took the 
            <strong>opportunity</strong> to communicate with the art side and get their opinions on the state of the game.
            <br><br>
            This helped take off the load of communication from the team leader as I was in charge of sending the message
            of the artists to the programmers who were too busy working and needed concise information.
