            About Christian
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a Game Dev student, hailing from Singapore and currently studying in <strong>Nanyang Polytechnic</strong>, Diploma for Game Development and Technology as of 2023.
        <br><br>
            Growing up with electronics, I've grown a passion to tinker aroune with them and ultimately ended up learning how to <strong>code</strong> and have not stopped learning since.
        <br><br>
            Other than coding, I do find myself doing other <strong>activities</strong> such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="blue">
            <li>Playing Piano & Organ</li>
            <li>Playing Video Games</li>
            <li>Listening to Music</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Other than activites, my other <strong>interests</strong> are here as well:
        </p>
        <ul class="purple">
            <li>Audiophile (IEMs, Headphones)</li>
            <li>Mechanical Keyboards</li>
            <li>Anime</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            For my primary education, I studied at <strong class="purple">Beacon Primary School</strong> from 2012 to 2017.

        <h2>Coding Backstory</h2>
        <p>
            During my primary school days, I had the opportunity to try out coding in Scratch and even a bit of python. I even went for a small coding competition across primary schools.
            <br><br> 
            However, during secondary school, I was too bombarded with academics to pursue coding as a hobby, I set it aside often whenever I tried getting back into it.
            <br><br> 
            Coding was not originally my idea in mind in the future, but my diploma reignited the passion I had for coding when I was young.
            <br><br>
            Thanks to the friends that I have made, they helped me find my passion back into coding. It is always nice to work with friends on big projects.
