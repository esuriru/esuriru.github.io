            This keyboard took around 7 hours to lube all the switches and solder everything in.
            I took my time to lube all the switches in such a manner that it would not be
            too sluggish but yet change the sound. I think the product in the end came out quite well.
            Probably will be my daily driver for a while.
            <br><br>
            This keyboard is a piece of keyboard history. Once of the first budget keyboards that were
            released around 2017. I managed to get the case around 2020, and built it 2 times and then
            threw it in the closet. Only this year, 2023, was I bored enough to take it out of the closet
            and throw another build onto there. This time, I'm kind of liking this board and it is quite
            nice to use.

            The UTD360c is a clone of the OTD360c which is one of the first custom keyboards ever created by 
            koreans. Hence, it received alot of clout and hype and hence, it jacked up the price to up to <strong>$10000</strong>.
            <br><br> 
            This clone comes at around 400SGD which is reasonable for the keyboard quality that you get, and
            owners of the original board said that the UTD was super similar, and hence, quite a good deal.
            <br><br>
            My gripe comes with the fixed cable, you are not able to detach the cable which is kind of a bummer,
            but at the very least usable. You also had not much layout choices with this board, and the board comes with
            only top mount. However, I was able to mod the keyboard such that I could use a gummyworm O-ring 
            to mount the assembly and get a nicer feeling and sounding board overall.
            <br><br>
            The vintage MX browns were a nice touch and it was quite satisfying to type on for the
            most part. The keycaps were old doubleshot ABS keycaps that were retrieved from Cherry keyboards that
            were created even before I was born. Even though I thought the board was nice, I sold it off cause I was still early
            in the hobby, and I wanted to experience more boards.

            A collaboration between a growing audio company Letshueor, and 
            popular audiophile content creator GIZAUDIO, the Galileo was born,
            a $100 USD hybrid IEM that challenges the market.
            <br><br>
            My short outtake on this IEM is that it's great for
            listening to either vocals or orchestras. However,
            my music preference tends towards death/melodic metal, 
            which it still does okay in, but not the best.
            It was worth the asking price for.

            Another collaboration between a growing chi-fi company Truthear, and 
            popular audiophile content creator Crinacle, the Zero was born.
            <br><br>
            In my honest opinion, the bass on the zero is decent, the vocals on it sound a bit
            shouty and the soundstage feels fairly cramped on this IEM. Pretty decent for rock,
            and comes with decent accesories including a pouch. Not bad for around 60SGD, but 
            I'd skip this one if I were to look at it another time. Sold off already.
